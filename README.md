# producerConsumer

This program is an example of the Producer and Consumer Problem, in which
two different programs work between a buffer to manage items. The producer
creates the items, and the consumer consumes them, removing them from the
buffer.

The project is in a very rough state, but I am working on it to make it better.


Example of Code:

1 to Produce Item  
2 to Consume Item  
0 to Exit Program  

Enter Instruction: 1  
Item Created  
Enter Instruction: 1  
Item Created  
Enter Instruction: 1  
Buffer Full!  
Enter Instruction: 2  
Item Consumed  
Enter Instruction: 2  
Item Consumed  
Enter Instruction 2  
Buffer Empty!  
Enter Instruction: 0
